 ## How to run the project locally:

1. Download the files to your hard-drive.
2. Install Node.js as the runtime engine (https://nodejs.org/en/).
3. In the console, navigate to the downloaded directory, then run  `npm install' to install the dependent Node modules.
4. Run 'npm update' to update any modules that need it.
5. Run 'npm start' to initialize the website.

## How to view the webpage online:

## Thought process when creating the website
It's an educational website about Clean-Energy, with content provided by a clean-energy expert who wants to help educate Industrial
Utilities and State Energy Commissions on the realistic expectations for clean-energy integration costs and timelines.  States involved
are (CO, NV, AZ, UT).

## Any trade offs you made?
The website currently doesn't have a 'WoW' factor, because I still need to find something that fits the educational theme without 
taking away from the seriousness of the content.

## Anything you might implement with more time (features, fixes, technical debt corrections etc).
The website will have more educational pages added to it, and then likely change the education navigation to a 'dropdown' style.  An 
additional 'sponsors' page will likely be added, with links to power utilities and energy commissions.
